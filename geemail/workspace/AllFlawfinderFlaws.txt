Number of dangerous functions in C/C++ ruleset: 160

workspace/check_login.cpp:125:  [4] (format) printf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be
  exploited. Use a constant for the format specification. 
workspace/check_login.cpp:82:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows. Use snprintf or vsnprintf. Risk
  is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
workspace/read_message.cpp:19:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be overflowed. Perform bounds checking,
  use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than
  the maximum possible length. 
workspace/read_message.cpp:168:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows. Use snprintf or vsnprintf. Risk
  is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
workspace/register.cpp:53:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows. Use snprintf or vsnprintf. Risk
  is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
workspace/write_message.cpp:19:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be overflowed. Perform bounds checking,
  use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than
  the maximum possible length. 
workspace/write_message.cpp:230:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows. Use snprintf or vsnprintf. Risk
  is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
workspace/check_login.cpp:20:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated (it could cause a
  crash if unprotected). 
workspace/check_login.cpp:22:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for
  invalid pointers. 
workspace/check_login.cpp:57:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated (it could cause a
  crash if unprotected). 
workspace/check_login.cpp:64:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for
  invalid pointers. 
workspace/read_message.cpp:143:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated (it could cause a
  crash if unprotected). 
workspace/read_message.cpp:150:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for
  invalid pointers. 
workspace/register.cpp:28:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated (it could cause a
  crash if unprotected). 
workspace/register.cpp:35:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for
  invalid pointers. 
workspace/write_message.cpp:29:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for
  invalid pointers. 
workspace/write_message.cpp:205:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated (it could cause a
  crash if unprotected). 
workspace/write_message.cpp:212:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for
  invalid pointers.
